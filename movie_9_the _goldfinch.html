            Theodore Decker was 13 years old when his mother was killed in a bombing at 
            the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York. The tragedy changes the course of 
            his life, sending him on a stirring odyssey of grief and guilt, reinvention and
            redemption, and even love.

        <h2>Reviews</h2>
      
        Lily Haynes:
        This movie is pointless. It just throws a bunch of hot-button issues at
        a screen and doesn’t explore these issues in relationship with Theo. 
        This movie hits the worst balance of feeling too long with too many conflicts.
        It just doesn’t feel exciting at all. The only positive aspect of this mess 
        is that the actor who plays young Theo does a great job.
        creates a great slow burner of a story that has the best satisfying ending.
