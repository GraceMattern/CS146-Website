        <h2>Reviews</h2>
        Lily Haynes:
        Take Good Time and turn the production value up by a lot. Seeing the 
        opening shot in a Safdie brothers’ movie that wasn’t New York put me in 
        disbelief for a second. There are great performances out of everyone 
        involved (yes, even Adam Sandler, you gotta trust me on this one). 
        People even play themselves really well! The Weeknd was very believable 
        as a douche and Kevin Garrnett has Oscar buzz on his side now. And I 
        still had the trademark “I watched a Safdie Brothers movie oh god” 
        anxiety attack afterwards, they make really good movies.
